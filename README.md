# Online Course Management System
Online Course Management System (OCMS) is a project which aims at developing a computerized system to maintain notes and drive links of lectures recorded in online semesters to help students access study material easily. This system helps students learn whichever subjects they want from professors across three BITS campuses.

## Features of OCMS
1) Search for drive links based on:
 - Course name
 - Course ID
 - College name
 - Professor name
Year
2) Order notes
3) Upload notes

## Softwares used:
 - ### Next.js: 
 Next.js is an open-source web development framework built on top of Node.js that enables server-side rendering and the generation of static web pages in React-based online apps. Next.js is mentioned in the React documentation as one of the "Recommended Toolchains," recommending it to developers for "Building a
server-rendered webpage using Node.js. Whereas standard React apps can only render information in the client-side browser, Next.js expands this capabilities to encompass server-side applications.
 - ### React: 
 React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source JavaScript front-end toolkit for creating user interfaces with UI components. Meta (previously Facebook) and a community of individual developers and businesses manage it. With frameworks like Next.js, React may be used as a foundation for developing single-page, mobile, or server-rendered apps. React, on the other hand, is solely concerned with state management and displaying that information to the DOM, therefore constructing React apps frequently necessitates the usage of extra frameworks for routing and client-side functionality.
 - ### SQL: 
 sql is a programming language developed for managing data in a relational database management system (RDBMS) or stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
